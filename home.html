				<h2>Quick Guide</h2>

				<p>
					<b>Anabel</b> (<b>A</b>nalysis of <b>b</b>inding <b>e</b>vents) is a software designed for the analysis of binding curves with which to evaluate the interactions of biomolecules. Currently, Anabel supports exported kinetic datasets from Biacore, BLI, Score and an open data format. Furthermore, Anabel will help you to fit a model to your kinetic data and will calculate all kinetic constants. These include the observed binding constant (k<sub>obs</sub>), the association rate constant (k<sub>ass</sub>), the dissociation rate constant (k<sub>diss</sub>) as well as the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>).	
				</p>
				<h3> Analysis mode </h3>
				<p>
					At the moment, Anabel offers the following two methods for calculating all kinetic constants:
				</p>
                <h4> Evaluation Method 1: k<sub>obs</sub> Linearisation </h4>
				<p>
					The k<sub>obs</sub> linearisation method can be applied if several association binding curves are available which have been measured with different analyte concentrations. A dissociation is not needed for this type of analysis. All rate constants as well as the equilibrium dissociation constant are solemnly calculated from the measurement of different k<sub>obs</sub> values. Therefore, the same experiment needs to be performed multiple times with varying concentrations of analyte in solution. At least three binding curves with different analyte concentrations are needed. However, we recommend to use five or more concentrations. <a href="#kobs_lin">Click here to read more about the evaluation method 1.</a>
				</p>
                <h4> Evaluation Method 2: Single Curve Analysis </h4>
				<p>
					The single curve analysis method can be applied for a single binding curve if both a good association and a good dissociation region can be observed. However, if one of these regions does not show a clear exponential trend, the results will be statistically weak. After fitting the mathematical model to both sides of the same curve, the equilibrium dissociation constant can be determined. It is mandatory to say that the advantage of needing one experiment only results in a higher variation of the K<sub>D</sub> value. We recommend to always perform a reasonable amount of replicates. <a href="#sca">Click here to read more about the evaluation method 2.</a>
				</p>
				<h3 id="data_support"> Data support </h3>
				<p>
					Exported data from the following programs, methods or companies are supported in Anabel:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li> Biacore (add “biacore” to the filename). Exported biacore datasets are .txt files. </li>
					<li> Octet (add “octet” to the filename). Please use the complete exported raw data file and not the sensor position files for upload. Typically, raw data files are .xls files. </li>
					<li> Biametrics (add “biametrics” to the filename). The data format needs to be a .xls or .xlsx file. </li> 
				</ul>
				<p>
					It is important to add the datatype name somewhere in the file name so that Anabel can assign the files correctly. For example: If you have an exported biacore dataset file with the name “experiment.txt”, then you will have to alter its name to something like “experiment_biacore.txt” or “biacore_experiment.txt”. Thereafter, you can upload the file and analyse it in Anabel.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, it is also possible to upload any other data in an Anabel-compatible format. Simply use our provided excel file or bring your data to the following format:
				</p>
				<table border>
                     <colgroup>

                        <col width=100>

				</p>

				<p>
					Alternatively, you can also use an alternating x- and y- axes data format like this:
				</p>

				<table border>
                     <colgroup>
                        <col width=100>
                        <col width=100>
                        <col width=100>
                        <col width=100>
                    </colgroup>

					<tr>
						<th>
							x-values A

				</table>

				<p>
					Save the table as a tab-delimited .txt file and add the name “biacore” to your filename. Otherwise, this alternating x- y-value pattern will not be recognised by Anabel.

				<h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
                    <p> 
                        In the following section we derive binding constants based on the assumption that a 1:1 binding occurs between a ligand L (on a surface) and an analyte A (in solution).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Determination of binding constants</h3>
                    
                    <figure class="figure">
                        <img src="picture1.png" width="800" align="middle">
						<figcaption class="figure-caption">Different regions of a binding experiment.</figcaption>
					</figure>
                    
                    <p>
						The interaction of a ligand L with an analyte A, forming a ligand-analyte complex AL, can be described by the following chemical reaction <a href="#[1]">[1]–[3]</a>:
                    </p>
                    <figure class="figure">
                        <img src="picture2.png" width="400" align= "middle">
						<figcaption class="figure-caption">Schematic chemical binding reaction of the analyte A to the ligand L.</figcaption>
					</figure>
                    
                    <p>
						In this reaction, k<sub>ass</sub> and k<sub>diss</sub> are the rate constants for the association and dissociation of the analyte-ligand complex. A reaction with two molecules forming one complex is called a bimolecular reaction, whereas the disintegration of one complex into two molecules is a unimolecular reaction. The more AL complex is built, the higher are the concentrations of free molecules A and/or L and the higher is the rate constant of association k<sub>ass</sub> (1). In contrast, the higher the concentration of the complex (AL) and the higher the rate constant of dissociation k<sub>diss</sub> are, the more AL complex will decay into A and L (2). Therefore, the building rate of the analyte-ligand formation (d[AL]/dt) can be described by the following differential equation (3) <a href="#[3]">[3]</a>:
                    </p>


                        $$\frac{d[AL]}{dt}=k_{ass}\cdot{[A]}\cdot{[L]}$$
                   
                        $$\frac{d([A]+[L])}{dt}=k_{diss}\cdot{[AL]}$$

                        $$\frac{d[AL]}{dt}=k_{ass}\cdot{[A]}\cdot{[L]}-k_{diss}\cdot{[AL]}$$

                    
                    <p>
                        In the equilibrium state, equation (3) will become zero and can be rearranged to form the law of mass action equation for our biomolecular reaction.  
						Subsequently, the association constant (K<sub>A</sub>) and the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>), which is the reciprocal of K<sub>A</sub>, <a href="#[3]">[3]</a> can be described as follows:
                    </p>
                    
                    
                        $$K_A=\frac{k_{ass}}{k_{diss}}=\frac{[AL]}{[A]\cdot{[L]}}=\frac{1}{K_D}$$
                    
                    <p>
						However, this model is only valid for a homogeneous system in which both the ligand and the analyte are in solution, are not limited by any transport processes or steric hindrances and react in a 1:1 manner. When performing microarray experiments, a surface supporting the microarray is mandatory. This already creates a strong steric hindrance and limitation for the binding process. That fact has to be taken into account. Since the ligand molecule is immobilised on a surface and the analyte is flushed over this surface inside a microfluidic chamber (Figure 3), further assumptions have to be made. For such binding events on surfaces, the flow velocity close to the surface is assumed to be zero (no slip condition), thereby creating a thin diffusion layer above the immobilised ligand L <a href="#[4]">[4]</a>. Hence, an analyte A being flushed over the chip has to cross the diffusion zone via diffusion before binding to the ligand. This process is generally called mass transport. If the analyte binds so quickly to the ligand that its concentration directly on the surface is lower than in the bulk solution and depletion occurs, then the binding kinetic is mass transport-limited. In order to reveal the binding kinetics, the supply of analytes has to be vastely increased. This can be ensured by high flow rates and/or high concentrations of analyte <a href="#[1]">[1]</a>, <a href="#[2]">[2]</a>.

                    <p>
						Apparently, the model for describing binding kinetics on surfaces becomes much more complicated. To simplify the equation, a linear concentration gradient is assumed inside the diffusion layer. With this simplification, the details of mass transport and other effects like molecular crowding or zeta-potentials are neglected for the purpose of solving the equation. Using the gradient assumption, the velocity of the analyte-ligand complex formation on a surface can be described as equation (5). Details about the mathematical background and how to derive the equations can be obtained from <a href="#[1]">[1]–[3]</a>.

                        $$\frac{dΓ(t)}{dt}=k_{ass}\cdot{[A]}\cdot{(Γ_{max}-Γ(t))}-k_{diss}\cdot{Γ(t)}$$
                    


                    <p>
                        The previous ligand concentration is replaced by the surface load capacity (Γ(t)). It describes the amount of analyte-ligand complexes per surface area at a given time point t. Hence, Γ<sub>max</sub> refers to the maximum amount of complexes per surface area unit. Subsequently, equation (3) can be rearranged to:
                    </p>

                        $$\frac{dΓ(t)}{dt}=k_{ass}\cdot{[A]}\cdot{Γ_{max}}-(k_{ass}\cdot{[A]}+k_{diss})\cdot{Γ(t)}$$
                  
                    <p>
						If the concentration of analyte [A] is kept constant during the experiment, this differential equation can be solved with the following function (mathematical derivation is shown in <a href="#[1]">[1], [2]</a>), which is refered to as binding model from here onward:
                    </p>


                        $$Γ(t)=Γ_{GG}-Γ_{GG}\cdot{e^{-k_{obs}\cdot{t}}}$$

                        $$k_{obs}=k_{ass}\cdot{[A]}+k_{diss}$$


                    <p>
						Γ<sub>GG</sub> describes the equilibrium surface load capacity where Γ(t) approximates to a constant value over time. Moreover, k<sub>obs</sub> represents the observable binding rate constant. Furthermore, k<sub>obs</sub> is dependent on the concentration of analyte [A] and the rate constants for association k<sub>ass</sub> and dissociation k<sub>diss</sub>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This derived mathematical model can now be used for the fitting of the association and dissociation binding signals (Figure 1). Thereby, an observable rate constant k<sub>obs</sub> can be calculated for every exponential curve. The k<sub>obs</sub> value generally describes the curvature. In case of an association curve fit, k<sub>obs</sub> includes both the association and the dissociation rate constant (6). However, in case of a dissociation curve fit, the analyte concentration is zero. Neglecting avidity and rebinding effects, the mathematical equation can be simplified to (9):

                            </h4>
							The binding rate constants are solemnly calculated through the k<sub>obs</sub> values gained from association fits. According to equation (6), the rate constant k<sub>kobs</sub> linearly depends on [A]. In order to perform a linear fit, a minimum number of three k<sub>obs</sub> values with varying concentrations needs to be measured (five or more different concentrations are recommended). Thereafter, the different k<sub>obs</sub> values are simply plotted vs. the concentration [A]. The linear regression is calculated using equation (6) with the slope as k<sub>ass</sub> and the y-axis intercept as k<sub>diss</sub>. Using these rate constants, the K<sub>D</sub> value can be calculated (K<sub>D</sub>=k<sub>diss</sub>/k<sub>ass</sub>). Have a look at the <a href="#kobs_lin"> Evaluation Method 1</a> section to gain a deeper understanding of this method and learn how to apply it in Anabel.

                        The binding constants are calculated from a single binding curve by performing an association and a dissociation fit.

                <h3>
                    Introduction
                </h3>
				<p>
					The k<sub>obs</sub> linearisation is one of Anabel’s methods to obtain all relevant binding constants. Based on the model and equations derived in the <a href="#theoretical_background">theoretical background</a>, the k<sub>obs</sub> values of 1:1                           binding events can be described by the following equation (10):
				</p>


                    $$k_{obs}=k_{ass}\cdot{[A]}+k_{diss}$$


                <p>
					Herein, the reagent concentration [A] refers to the concentration of free, dissolved analyte A, whilst the ligand L is immobilised on the surface. Please note: Anabel is only designed to investigate binding events in which one binding partner has been immobilised on a sensor surface (Figure 3; <a href="#theoretical_background">Theoretical Background</a>) and the other stays in solution. This setup is typical for nearly any solid phase biosensor. The actual software version is only capable of analysing 1:1 reactions.
                </p>
                <p>
					When using the k<sub>obs</sub> linearisation method, only the association region (Figure 4) will be used for fitting. A k<sub>obs</sub> value can be calculated for every association curve with help of the binding model. This will leave us with the two unknown variables k<sub>ass</sub> and k<sub>diss</sub>, as the analyte concentration is defined through the experimental setting. In order to calculate the desired constants (k<sub>ass</sub> and k<sub>diss</sub>) via k<sub>obs</sub>-linearisation, it is necessary to repeat the binding experiment with varying analyte concentrations. In other words: If you do not have datasets with at least three different reagent concentrations, you are not able to perform a k<sub>obs</sub> linearisation. In this case, the only analysis that might be possible is <a href="#sca">Evaluation Method 2: Single Curve Analysis</a>. WARNING: Values obtained from one single curve are never as precise as values obtained from Evaluation Method 1.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Data preparation and upload
                </h3>

                <p>
					To perform a fit in Anabel, one has to prepare the data for upload first. Check our <a href="#data_support">data support</a> section to find out which datasets and -types are currently supported by Anabel.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Curve fitting:
                </h4>
                <p>
					After uploading the dataset, Anabel will start by generating an overview plot over the whole time range of the experiment. This time range can be altered using the slider below the overview graph. If the dataset shows a systematic drift, one might think of performing a single or dual drift correction. Go to the <a href="#curve_manipulation">curve manipulation section</a> to find out more on this topic. 
                    The overview graph is not sufficient to choose an exact fitting region. Therefore, one has to zoom into the association region by drawing a rectangle into the overview graph in order to generate the zoomed graph (Figure 5). It is recommended to extend this area slightly beyond the intended fitting region. Thereby, the later choice of the exact fitting region becomes much easier to make.       
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thereafter, the fitting region can be selected within the zoomed graph (again by drawing a rectangle) (Figure 6). Make sure to only fit the association region when performing a k<sub>obs</sub> linearization.                             Furthermore, do not include data points before or after the association curve.

               <p>
                    As an R based program, Anabel uses the following code (11) to perform the fit:
               </p>


                 
                  $$fm\lt-nls\,(\,y\sim{a}\cdot{exp}(-b\cdot{x})+c, \,start=list\,(\,a=a,b=b,c=c)) $$


               <p>
				   <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/nls.html">NLS</a> (Non-linear least squares) is a R fitting routine to estimate the parameters of a non-linear model as described by equation (12).
               </p>

                    $$f(t)=a\cdot{e^{-b\cdot{t}}}+c$$
                

               <p>
                    The nls function also needs initial values for the parameters a, b and c. The following exponential assumptions (13-15) can be used to calculate good approximations for these initial values:
               </p>


                    $$f(0)=a+c\\
                    a=min\,(\,first\,three\,values\,)-c$$ 


                    $$\lim_{x\to\infty}f(t)=a\\
                    c=max\,(\,last\,three\,values\,)-\frac{1}{3}\cdot{a}$$                   


                    $$f(τ)=c+\frac{a}{e}\\
                    c+\frac{a}{e}=a\cdot{e^{-b\cdot{τ}}}+c\\
                    e^{-1}=e^{-b\cdot{τ}}\\	
                    b=\frac{1}{τ}$$	




                <figure class="figure">

						<figcaption class="figure-caption">Estimation of constant b as a starting value for the NLS fitting routine.</figcaption>
					</figure>


               <p>
				   As the number of values to calculate the initial values with is limited by the range of selected data points in the zoomed graph, f(0) is set to be the minimum of the first three chosen data values (13). Likewise, the maximum of the last three chosen data values is used for f(t→infinity) (14). With these assumptions, it is possible to estimate c (14) and a (13). Additionally, the c value is increased by one third of the distance “a” as the “real” maximum value of the asymptote is usually larger than the chosen maximum values, including their noise. Generally, this should increase the stability of the fit. The constant b is a bit more difficult to estimate (15). For this purpose, the characteristic time constant Γ is estimated. Γ represents the time at which the distance of the y-value and the constant c equals –a/e (Figure 7), the step response of the system. Therefore, this time point has a value of c+a/e (15). After solving the equation, b can be estimated as 1/Γ. As the value of a/e is approximately 0.4 (or 40%), Anabel simply looks up the time point that is closest to this 40%, which is (a+c) + 0.6*(-a) (Figure 7).Having estimated the initial parameters, the R nls function starts to refine the parameters a, b and c through an iterative least square process. Compared to the binding model (7) derived from the <a href="#theoretical_background">theoretical background</a> section, all relevant constants are defined as follows (16-19):
               </p>

               
                    $$f(t)=y_0+A_0\cdot{e^{-k_{obs}\cdot{t}}}$$	

                 
                    $$y_0=c$$


                    $$A_0=a$$


                    $$k_{obs}=b$$




               <p>
				   Additionally, all standard errors are calculated by the nls model routine. Anabel will visualise the resulting fit within the “fit” panel (Figure 8). The calculated parameters will show up in a table above the “save results” button. Furthermore, it is possible to refine the fit by changing the fitting region in the zoomed graph. Simply expand, reduce or shift the selection to automatically update all values. The selection of the “right” area for the association fit can be tricky. Moreover, it is the most difficult part of the whole data analysis and has the highest impact on the final results. In order to find the best fitting region, Anabel offers assisting analysis graphs, which analyse the chosen fitting region. They can help to decide if a fitting area should be reduced or expended. Read more about the assisting analysis graphs and how to perform the optimal fit in the <a href="#analysis_graphs">assisting analysis graphs</a> section.

                    Finally, if the fit is as good as possible, click on “save results” to save and yank the current fit. Its statistics will then appear in the “all saved fit results” table. Moreover, Anabel will yank the fit graph and the overview graph to finally generate the result file. In theory, the fitting procedure explained above can be repeated as often and with as many data points as needed. This also includes the upload of several different datasets.

               <h3>
                   K<sub>obs</sub> linearisation:
               </h3>
               <p>
                   In the last step of the k<sub>obs</sub> linearisation method, the actual k<sub>obs</sub> linearisation will be performed. As already indicated with equation (10), it is important to calculate multiple k<sub>obs</sub> values for the binding event using different reagent concentrations [A]. In other words: The binding experiment has to be performed multiple times over a well-defined range of reagent concentrations. Finding the perfect concentrations can be difficult. Ideally, they should range from 0.1 to 10-times of the K<sub>D</sub> value. However, as this value is not known beforehand we recommend to perform as many experiments as possible to cover a big range of concentrations. It is also reasonable to perform replicates for the same concentrations to improve statistics.
               </p>
               <p>
                   Inherently, Anabel does not know the reagent concentrations applied for the experiments. Thus, it is important to edit the “all saved fit results” table by assigning the analyte [A] concentrations to the calculated k<sub>obs</sub> values. Each row in the table has a unique identifier on its very left side. Use this row number in the form on the left side of the table to edit the corresponding row. It is necessary to provide a concentration for every k<sub>obs</sub> value that will be used for the later k<sub>obs</sub> linearisation. Additionally, it is possible to change the spot names and to add some commentary. If the form is filled in completely, click on “update table” to update the corresponding rows. It is also possible to edit several rows at once by separating the row ID numbers using a “,” (selecting them individually) or a “-“ (selecting a range of rows). After choosing the “-“ selector for the row IDs, it is either possible to apply the same information to all chosen rows or to apply multiple arguments by separating them with a comma. When using the “,”-selector for the row IDs, it is possible to individually apply the reagent concentrations, names or comments to the appropriate rows. Thereby, the order of the given arguments separated by “,” is important. If any mistake has been made in the form, nothing will happen when “update table” is clicked and Anabel will wait until everything is filled in correctly. In case of mistakes, it is always possible to edit the same table row multiple times.
               </p>
               <p>
                    Finally, Anabel offers two different ways to carry out the k<sub>obs</sub> linerisation. If the “automatically by name” option has been selected, Anabel will find all values with the same name and will plot their k<sub>obs</sub> values against their reagent concentrations. After selecting the “single” option, Anabel will use all values from the “all saved fit results table” which are highlighted in grey. The data frame rows can be highlighted by clicking on them. Subsequently, Anabel tries to find a common name for all the selected k<sub>obs</sub> values, which will appear in the “name” field. However, it is also possible to change this name into something more reasonable.
                    Either way, Anabel will use the selected data points to perform a linear fit according to the following R command (20) and its mathematical equation (21):
               </p>
              
                    $$fit=glm\,(\,y\sim{x}\,)$$

                    $$f(x)=mx+b$$


               <p>
				   The <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/glm.html">glm</a> (generalised linear model) function is an R routine for the calculation of all parameters of a linear fit and their corresponding standard errors. Compared to equation (10) and figure 9 B, the calculated slope (m) is equal to the association rate constant (k<sub>ass</sub>), whereas the y-axis intercept equals the dissociation rate constant (k<sub>diss</sub>). Attention: A linear fit only appears after a selection of three or                      more data points. The binding constant K<sub>D</sub> (22) and its standard error (23) can easily be calculated using the following equations:
               </p>


                    $$K_D=\frac{k_{diss}}{k_{ass}}$$			

				    $$s_{k_D}=K_D\cdot\sqrt{\frac{s_{k_{diss}}^2}{k_{diss}^2}\cdot\frac{s_{k_{ass}}^2}{k_{ass}^2}}$$

                   In the final step, click on “save fit” in order to yank the linear fit results. Subsequently, all relevant binding constants will appear in a small table underneath the “save fit” button. If more data points have been analysed, the results will of course add up to the already existing ones.

               <h3>
                   Introduction
               </h3>

               <p>
                   The single curve analysis is Anabel’s second method to obtain all relevant binding kinetic constants. Compared to Evaluation Method 1, the binding model is not only fitted to the association curve but also to the dissociation curve. However, the following equation (24) is true for both Anabel methods:
               </p>
               
                    $$k_{obs}=k_{ass}\cdot{[A]}+k_{diss}$$

               <p>
				   Herein, the reagent concentration [A] refers to the concentration of free, dissolved analyte A which can bind to the immobilised ligand L. Please note: Anabel is only designed to investigate binding events where one binding partner has been immobilised on a sensor surface (Figure 3; <a href="#theoretical_background">Theoretical Background</a>), whereas the other binding partner stays in solution. This setup is typical for nearly any solid phase biosensor. The current software version is capable of analysing 1:1 reactions. As Anabel is an open source program published on githup, everyone can alter the equations in order to analyse different binding kinetics.
               </p>
               <p>
Using the single curve analysis method, it is possible to calculate both rate constants (k<sub>ass</sub> and k<sub>diss</sub>) through the analysis of a single binding curve. The fit to the dissociation curve will reveal a k<sub>obs</sub> value that equals the dissociation constant k<sub>diss</sub> as the analyte concentration is thought to be zero (24). Together with the k<sub>obs</sub> value obtained from the fit to the association curve, the k<sub>ass</sub> constant can be calculated. We will come back to these equations later in more detail. In general, a single curve analysis can only be performed if good on- and off-kinetics are visible in the data. WARNING: Values obtained from a single curve analysis are never as precise and statistically significant as values obtained from the Evaluation Method 1.

                   Data preparation and upload:
               </h3>

               <p>
				   To perform a fit in Anabel, one has to prepare the data for upload first. Check our <a href="#data_support">data support</a> section to find out which datasets and –types are currently supported by Anabel.
               </p>

               <h3>
                   Curve fitting
               </h3>

               <p>
                   After uploading the dataset, Anabel will start by generating an overview plot over the whole time range of the experiment. This time range can be altered using the slider below the overview graph. However, the overview graph alone is not well suited to choose an exact fitting region. Therefore, one has to zoom into the association or dissociation region by drawing a rectangle into the overview graph in order to generate the zoomed graph (Figure 11). It is recommended to extend this area slightly beyond the intended fitting region. Thus, the later choice of the exact fitting region becomes much easier.  
               </p>

				</figure>


               <p>
                   Thereafter, the fitting region can be selected within the zoomed graph (again by drawing a rectangle) (Figure 12). Make sure not to include data points before or after the association or dissociation curve respectively. 
               </p>

					</figure>


               <p>
                   As Anabel is an R based program, it uses the following code (25) to perform the fit:
               </p>

                  $$fm\lt-nls\,(\,y\sim{a}\cdot{exp}(-b\cdot{x})+c, \,start=list\,(\,a=a,b=b,c=c)) $$


               <p>
				   <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/nls.html">NLS</a> (Non-linear least squares) is an R fitting routine to estimate the parameters of a non-linear model as described by equation (26).
               </p>
               
               $$f(t)=a\cdot{e^{-b\cdot{t}}}+c$$


               <p>
                   The nls function also needs initial values for the parameters a, b and c. The following exponential assumptions (27-29) can be used to calculate good approximations for these initial values:
               </p>

                    $$f(0)=a+c\\
                    a=min\,(\,first\,three\,values\,)-c$$ 


                    $$\lim_{x\to\infty}f(t)=a\\
                    c=max\,(\,last\,three\,values\,)-\frac{1}{3}\cdot{a}$$                   


                    $$f(τ)=c+\frac{a}{e}\\
                    c+\frac{a}{e}=a\cdot{e^{-b\cdot{τ}}}+c\\
                    e^{-1}=e^{-b\cdot{τ}}\\	
                    b=\frac{1}{τ}$$


               <figure class="figure">
                        <img src="picture13.png" width="800" align= "middle">
						<figcaption class="figure-caption">Estimation of constant b as a starting value for the NLS fitting routine.</figcaption>
					</figure>



               <p>
As the number of values to calculate the initial constants with is limited by the range of selected data points in the zoomed plot, f(0) is set to be the minimum of the first three chosen data values (27). Likewise, the maximum of the last three chosen data values is used for f(t→infinity) (28). With these assumptions, it is possible to estimate c (28) and a (27). Additionally, the c value is increased by one third of the distance “a” as the “real” maximum value of the asymptote is usually larger than the chosen maximum values, including their noise. Generally, this should increase the stability of the fit. 
The constant b is a bit more difficult to estimate (29). For this purpose, the characteristic time constant τ is estimated. τ represents the time at which the distance between the y-value and the constant c equals –a/e (Figure 13), the step response of the system. Therefore, this time point has a value of c+a/e (29). After solving the equation, b can be estimated as 1/ τ. As the value of a/e is approximately 0.4 (or 40%), Anabel simply searches the time point that is closest to these 40%, which is (a+c) + 0.6*(-a) (Figure 13). 
Having estimated the initial parameters, the R nls function starts to refine the parameters a, b and c through an iterative least square process. Compared to the binding model (30) derived from the <a href="#theoretical_background">theoretical background</a> section, all relevant constants are defined as follows(31-33):
               </p>

                $$f(t)=y_0+A_0\cdot{e^{-k_{obs}\cdot{t}}}$$	

                 
                    $$y_0=c$$


                    $$A_0=a$$


                    $$k_{obs}=b$$




               <p>
				   Additionally, all standard errors are calculated by the nls model routine. Anabel will visualise the resulting fit within the “fit” panel (Figure 14). The calculated parameters will show up in a table underneath the “analysis graphs and residual plot” section. Furthermore, it is possible to refine the fit by changing the fitting region in the zoomed graph. Simply expand, reduce or shift the selection to automatically update all values. The selection of the “right” area for the association fit can be tricky. Moreover, it is the most difficult part of the whole data analysis and has the highest impact on the final results. In order to find the best fitting region, Anabel offers assisting analysis graphs, which analyse the chosen fitting region. They can help to decide whether or not a fitting area should be reduced or expended.  Read more about the assisting analysis graphs and how to perform the optimal fit in the <a href="#analyte_graphs">assisting analysis graphs</a> section.

               <p>
                   Finally, if the fit is as good as possible, either click on “yank association fit” to save a fit to the association curve, or click on “yank dissociation fit” to save a fit made to a dissociation curve. The fit statistics will then appear underneath the respective button. After pushing one of the yank buttons, Anabel will also save the fit graph and the overview graph to generate the result file. In theory, the fitting procedure explained above can be repeated as often and with as many data points as needed. This also includes the subsequent upload of several different datasets. However, in order to proceed with the single curve analysis, it is crucial to yank a fit to the association and the dissociation region of the same curves. We recommend to perform an association fit first and to subsequently proceed with the dissociation fit for the same curves. 
               </p>

               <h3>
                   Single curve analysis:
               </h3>

               <p>
                   After yanking the fits to the association and dissociation regions of the same curves, it is necessary to supply the correct reagent concentration with which the experiment has been performed. Subsequently, click on “analyse yanked fit results” to receive a table containing all binding constants. As indicated in the beginning, Anabel calculates the k<sub>diss</sub> value through the dissociation curve fit. Yet, our binding model will only reveal a k<sub>obs</sub> (the observed binding rate constant) value. When immobilised molecules first come into contact with their freely diffusible binding partners (analyte A), an association curve can be measured. In this process, a huge fraction of analyte starts to bind to the immobilised molecules. However, there are always off- and on-kinetic processes taking place simultaneously. Because of this fact, it impossible to measure a pure association and to subsequently calculate a true association rate constant only. Instead, an observable binding constant (k<sub>obs</sub>) is measured. In order to measure a dissociation curve, the immobilised molecules and their bound analyte molecules are washed with an analyte-free buffer. If no rebinding occurs and the flow rates are quite high, it can be assumed that the reagent concentration [A] is zero. Hence, the resulting k<sub>obs</sub> value equals the dissociation rate constant (34).
               </p>


               $$k_{obs}=k_{ass}\cdot{[A]}+k_{diss}=k_{ass}\cdot{0}+k_{diss}=k_{diss}$$
                

               <p>
                   All other constants and their standard errors are calculated as follows (35-38):
               </p>

               $$K_{ass}=\frac{k_{obs}-k_{diss}}{[A]}$$

               $$s_{k_{ass}}=\frac{1}{[A]}\cdot\sqrt{s_{k_{obs}}^2+s_{k_{diss}}^2}$$
                   
               $$K_D=\frac{k_{diss}}{k_{ass}}$$			

			   $$s_{k_D}=K_D\cdot\sqrt{\frac{s_{k_{diss}}^2}{k_{diss}^2}\cdot\frac{s_{k_{ass}}^2}{k_{ass}^2}}$$


               <p>
                   The whole single curve analysis procedure can be repeated with different curves as often as desired. It is also possible to upload completely new datasets without losing the results from the previous ones.

				<h2>Assisting Analysis Graphs</h2>

                <p>
					This section will explain and show how to obtain better fitting results by having a detailed look at the assisting analysis graphs. After a fitting region has been chosen in the zoomed graph (Figure 15, A), Anabel extracts the data (blue area) and an exponential fit is performed using the 1:1 binding model (<a href="#theoretical_background">Theoretical background</a> section). This fit over the complete binding curve is named “global” fit (Figure 15, B). 
                </p>

                <figure class="figure">
                        <img src="picture15.png" width="800" align= "middle">
						<figcaption class="figure-caption"><b>A:</b>Selection of global fitting region in the zoomed graph. <b>B:</b> Global fit performed by Anabel.</figcaption>
					</figure>


                <p>
                    A global fit over the complete binding curves would be perfect if no additional effects occurred and a 1:1 kinetic matched the reality. However, our model does not take effects like diffusion limited transport, depletion, back-binding, spot geometry or avidity into account. In the given example, one can see, that the global fit does not meet the curve. Therefore, it is not recommended to select a fit over the whole graph (global fit). In this case, it would make more sense to select a more suitable range for fitting. Anabel tries to help you to find the most suitable fitting region.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In our example (Figure 15, B), the start of the association is nearly linear (orange arrow). Most probably, mass transport limitation by diffusion has occurred (spot can bind more analyte than can be delivered onto it). In such cases, it is important to exclude this linear area from the global fitting region. The aim is to find a range, which only includes the exponential curve (local fitting area). In order to decide which data points should be taken for this local fit, an additional analysis can be performed in Anabel by clicking “Show” in the “analysis graphs and residual plot” section. Subsequently, three graphs will be calculated. The deviation plot is produced by plotting delta values Δf = f(t+1)-f(t) (y-axis) vs. time (x-axis). In the self-exponential plot, all delta values Δf = f(t+1)-f(t) (y-axis) are plotted against a normalised signal f(t) (x-axis). For the residual plot, the data points are plotted into a diagram normalised to the calculated fitting curve.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Be aware, that sometimes the data is so noisy that almost nothing can be seen in the analysis plots. To reduce the noise, it is possible to smooth the plots by calculating a running averaging over the dataset. Here, the standard default value is set to n=1. The number of data points taken for this running average can be set in the “Number of average points for curve smoothing” field. This will only effect the analysis plots; it will change nothing in your fit.
                </p>

				<h3>Deviation plot (delta vs. time)</h3> 

                <p>
                    A standard binding curve starts with a baseline, followed by an association phase with an exponential increase and a dissociation phase with an exponential decrease. The deviation plot itself is designed to detect these changes in the slope of the data. If no change is detectable (e.g. for the baseline), the deviation plot will stay around the same value (zero) and will show a horizontal progression in this region. A change in slope (as for the association and dissociation phase) will be displayed as an initial jump followed by a recovery back to the background signal. Here, the association phase will show an upwards jump with a subsequent decreasing progression. The dissociation phase will show a downwards jump and an subsequent increasing progression. To give you an impression of your selected fitting area with regard to the adjacent data points, Anabel will show the curve progression for the whole data range that is shown in the zoomed graph plot. The region that was chosen for fitting is more strongly colored and the lines are bolder. As we have picked an association curve fit in our example images (figure 16 B), the desired region for fitting should be located after the jump and cover most values before reaching the zero line. Remember: Smooth the deviation plot by applying a higher number for the running average in order to obtain a better impression of the curve trends. However, be aware that using a high running average number will flatten the signal jumps, which makes it harder to choose the right starting and end points for the fit. Thus, we recommend to choose the running average number as small as possible and as large as necessary to observe the curve changes.
                </p>

				<h3>Self-exponential plot (delta vs. normalised value)</h3>

                <p>
                    Again, a standard binding curve starts with a baseline, followed by an association phase with an exponential increase and a dissociation phase with an exponential decrease. Remember: In the self-exponential plot the x-axis does not display time, but the normalized signal f(t). Similar to the deviation plot, a change in slope of the binding curves (as for the association and dissociation phase) is represented by a value jump as well as a change of the normalised values. In case of an association curve, an upwards jump and in case of a dissociation curve, a downwards jump can be observed. Be aware that the self-exponential plot for a dissociation curve is mirrored compared to the one for an association curve. Therefore, the plots have to be read from left to right for an association curve and from right to left for a dissociation curve in terms of increasing time. A jump is always followed by a linear value decrease (for the association phase) or a linear value increase (for the dissociation phase). Upon reaching the zero baseline in the self-exponential plot the end of the binding curve is reached. Again, all values of the zoomed graph are shown in the self-exponential plot and the values which are applied for the fit are envisioned in stronger colors and bolder lines. In general, the desired region for fitting should be located after the jump (consider mirror inverted plots) and cover most values before reaching the zero line, forming a “linear area” (figure 16, B). Once again: Smooth the deviation plot by applying a higher number for the running average in order to obtain a better impression of the curve trends. However, be aware that using a high running average number will flatten the signal jumps, which makes it harder to choose the right starting and end points for the fit. Thus, we recommend to choose the running average number as small as possible and as large as necessary to observe the curve changes.
                </p>
                
                <p>
					With help of the information gained from the deviation and self-exponential plot the fitting areas of the binding curves can be adjusted more properly (figure 16, B+C). In our case, the resulting local fit (figure 16, D) represents our data much better than the initial global fit .Since we are only interested in the curvature of the data (as represented by the k<sub>obs</sub> value), it is very reasonable to use such a reduced fitting region for the analysis of binding events. However, this implicates that this method can only be used in regions, where a good exponential curvature can be observed. Otherwise, you may alter the k<sub>obs</sub> values in such a way that the calculations will then lead to completely wrong and misinterpreted binding constants. 
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Residual Plot
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Besides the two curve progression plots, Anabel also calculates a classic residual plot. In general, a residual plot describes the deviation of the observed data from the calculated fit. For each time point, the fit value is normalised to 1 and the deviation of the values from the fit are calculated as deviating fraction. Consequently, the zero line represents the fit and the experimental data values are displayed in relation to the fit values. Thus, the residual plot will enable you to see how “close” the data is related to the fit. In general, the data points should be randomly distributed around the zero line (Figure 17, A). Furthermore, Anabel calculates a smoothed conditional mean curve (with a default confidence interval of 95%) to help identifying trends in the plot. Moreover, the deviation is displayed as a density plot on the right side of the residual plot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With regard to our example, even the improved local fit shows regions that mainly lie above or underneath the zero line, implying that the fit is still not perfect (Figure 17, B). This may be due to additional binding effects and/or kinetics, but also to the fact that it may not be a true 1:1 interaction. Nonetheless, the density plot on the right side shows that the main peak is well placed in the area of the zero line. We can conclude, that the performed fit is most probably the most suitable fit we can achieve with the given data set. Yet, there are still effects in the measurement which prevent a true 1:1 binding.

				<h2>Curve Manipulations</h2>

                <h3>
                    Y-axis adjustment 
                </h3>

                <p>
Sometimes it can happen that several curves are displaced with regard to the y-axis and each other. In this case, Anabel offers a y-axis adjustment. Simply select the region (figure 18 A; shown in blue) and supply the value to which Anabel shall align the curves. Then, click on the button “y-axis adjustment”. Anabel will calculate the mean of the selected y-values and subtract it from the chosen value to which Anabel will align the curves. Thereafter, Anabel will add the resulting value to every data point of the curve. This adjustment will not change the general trend of the curve. In order to change the adjustment, simply select a new region and press “y-axis adjustment” one more time. To reset the dataset to the original one, simply click on the button “reset to original dataset” underneath the “drift correction” section. Furthermore, it is possible to customise the data range of the y-axis itself. Just change the “change default ymax” and “change default ymin” to the favoured values. 
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Drift correction 
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Sometimes, a general drift can be observed, especially in the baseline of the data. Such drifts can lead to systematic fitting errors and can cause major deviations in the calculation of the binding constants. Hence, performing a drift correction should be considered. Be aware that drift correcting your dataset will influence the kinetic values obtained after fitting. Anabel offers two different drift correction methods: a “single” drift correction and a “dual” drift correction. You can choose the appropriate method in the drift correction section.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Single drift correction:
                </h4>

                <p>
                    A single drift correction can be performed if a homogeneous drift is assumed and observed to be present in the data. We recommend to always start with this method. Anabel corrects all data points according to the following equation (39):
                </p>

                $$c(t)=f(t)-m\cdot{t}$$

                <p>
                    Herein, f(t) represents the values from the original dataset, m stands for the slope of the detected drift, t is the x-value (generally time) and c(t) is the drift-corrected dataset. In principal, a linear regression curve is calculated for every data series individually and is subtracted from each of them. For determining the linear regression, Anabel uses the R command below (40):
                </p>

                    $$fit=lm\,(\,f(t)\sim{t}\,, data=original\,dataset)$$

                 <p>
                     Perform a single drift correction by selecting as much of the baseline as possible in the overview graph (Figure 18, A). Then, click on “use selected area for drift correction”. Thereafter, Anabel will recalculate the overview graph with the drift-corrected data (Figure 18, B). Most probably, the curves will show a shift after the drift correction, which can easily be corrected through a y-axis adjustment. From now on, Anabel will only use the corrected dataset for all further evaluations. Again, be aware that drift correcting your dataset will influence the kinetic values obtained after fitting.
                 </p>

                     It is possible to reset the data to the original dataset by pressing the “reset to original dataset” button.

                <h4>
                    Dual drift correction:                
                </h4>

                <p>
                    A dual drift correction can be applied if there are clear differences between the drifts at the beginning and at the end of a binding experiment. Moreover, it can also be performed if the single drift correction did not yield the desired results. Figure 19 shows a dataset containing a dual drift. After performing a single drift correction (Figure 19 A), the first baseline appears to be horizontal (Figure 19 B). However, the curves still show a clear drift at the end of the binding experiment. This might be due to more than one independent drifts inside the dataset (e.g. temperature and aging of the biosensor molecules). A dual drift correction can now help to gain even better results. However, the dual drift correction is a major data set manipulation and should only be performed with caution.
                </p>

						<figcaption class="figure-caption"><b>A:</b> Selecting the drift correction area for the single drift correction. <b>B:</b> Binding curve after performing a single drift correction. Here, drifts can still be observed at the end of the curves. A dual drift correction might help.</figcaption>
				</figure>

                <p>
                    In order to perform a dual drift correction in Anabel, three areas must be selected within the overview graph. Step 1: Select the first baseline in the overview graph at the beginning of the binding experiment (Figure 20 A) and click the button “first drift area”. Step 2: Select the second baseline at the end of the binding experiment and click the button “second drift area” (Figure 20 B). Step 3: Select the area of the binding event (between the areas selected in step 1 and 2) and click on “cross-fade area” (Figure 20 C). Thereafter, Anabel will calculate the new dual drift-corrected dataset according to the following equation (41):
                </p>

                <p>
\begin{equation}
c(t)=
\begin{cases}                
\begin{array}{l}
{f(t)-m_1\cdot t},\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\;\; t\le T_0\\
{f(t)-(m_1\cdot t+\frac{t-T_0}{T_{max}-T_0}\cdot(m_2\cdot t-m_1\cdot t))},\qquad\qquad T_0\lt t \lt T_{max}\\
{f(t)-m_2\cdot t},\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\;\; t\ge T_{max}
\end{array}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

                </p>

                <p>
					c(t) represents the corrected dataset values, m<sub>1</sub> is the drift slope of the first area, m<sub>2</sub> is the drift slope of the second area, T<sub>0</sub> is the very left x-value and T<sub>max</sub> the very right x-value of the cross-fading area. In general, Anabel linearly crossfades drift one into drift two within the crossfading area (Figure 20 C). Therefore, the influence of drift one (the first baseline) decreases from 100% at T<sub>0</sub> to 0% at T<sub>max</sub>, whereas drift two (second baseline) increases from 0% at T<sub>0</sub> to 100% at T<sub>max</sub>. From now on, Anabel will use the dual drift-corrected dataset (Figure 20 D) for every further calculation. In order to reset the data to the original dataset, simply click on “reset to original dataset”. 
Warning: The dual drift correction is a major dataset manipulation and should only be performed with caution. This is partly due to the fact that one assumes that both drifts are independent. Moreover, we can only suppose that both drifts crossfade linearly. Thus, be aware that dual drift correction positively alters the appearance of the graphs, but will diminish the reliability of the fit.
